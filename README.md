I got something working with the new discord embedding sdk
- make sure to follow [this](https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/building-an-activity) to get credentials set up and all that good stuff
- env.example:
```.env
VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=xxxxx
CLIENT_SECRET=xxxx
```
# Have fun!
- note, sveltekit probably not the best framework for this, it relies too much on apis restricted by the sdk
